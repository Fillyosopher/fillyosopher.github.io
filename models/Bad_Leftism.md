# Bad Leftism

## The Model

I find Leftists seem to start in one of two pretty shitty positions. These two positions both have important things to say, and the better positions are a mix of the two.

A. The bad leftist position is optimize for doing absolutely no harm.  
B. A better leftist position is optimize for doing the most good to those who need it, so long as no one else is inconvenienced.
C. The best leftist position is optimize the most relative good. harm 10 rich people by 30% income to make 10000 poor people happier by 30% income. It's not enough to avoid harm, you have to seek out good trades. Avoiding harm just leaves the status quo in place. It's not enough to harm problematic people, you have to
D. An okay leftist position is optimize for only harming those with power.
E. An bad leftist position is optimize for harming 'your enemies'.

## Angel Fallacy and Devil Fallacy

I sometimes call A the Angel Fallacy and E the Devil Fallacy.

### Angel Fallacy

The Angel Fallacy is to think that avoiding individual harm will naturally lead to a world of happy people. That by immediately reacting to and ending harm, everyone will be sufficiently happy.

This strategy loses to a limited definition of harm and slowness of action.  
Without fitting punishment, those who break the rules end up rich, as their illgotten gains remain theirs.

There are a few paths out of the Angel Fallacy. One is to expand the definition of harm, so that harm against the environment or society at large is counted. Another is to optimize for helping rather than avoiding harm.

### Devil Fallacy

The Devil Fallacy is to think that punishing anyone who is individually problematic can eventually dissuade or remove all the problematic people from society. By being proactive in destroying what is bad, we can solve things.

This strategy loses to expanded definitions of harm. If everything is a problem, then no one is an ally, the punishment has no aim, and nothing is accomplished.

There are a few paths out of the Devil Fallacy. One is to be very limited in what one punishes, shrinking the field of punishable actions to a filtered list. Another is to optimize for redistribution over destruction.
