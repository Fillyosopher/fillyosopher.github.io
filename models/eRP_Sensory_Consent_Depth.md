# eRP "Sensory Depth Consent" guide

## The model

1. I assume no consent, I only pose myself and let the other person react to everything. I might "start to push" but never "push" which assumes they allowed me to push them.
2. I have consent to describe not just how I am, but the environment.
3. I have consent to describe sensations as enjoyable or not, assuming for the person what they'll think of it in small ways. Not just "X smell" but " a good X smell", "an enticing kiss".
4. I have consent to occasionally pickup/move the person or assume obvious consequence, eg "I kiss you and you kiss back"
5. I have consent to shallowly describe how the person reacts or feels due to my actions, eg "I penetrate you and the stretch feels achy and wonderful"
6. I have consent to deeply describe, in loose terms, how the other person's body reacts and mind thinks. eg "The constant pressure making you wetter by the minute", "you can't help thinking about X"

Notice, as you move up the scale, it becomes more common (but not required) for the depths levels of participants to differ. The more passive partner(s) often stays back a few stages from the more active partner(s), and this is even more noticable in D/s scenes.

## Subbing: going below 1 Consent Depth

(Markdown doesn't like numbers under 1)

0. I can only react to what the other person does, I am not allowed to initiate actions.

-1) I am only allowed to react in specific, predefined ways.

-2) I am not allowed to react whatsoever (other than safeword), I am completely in their control and everything I do is because they made me.

Note, it's common for a player to be somewhat constrainted, such as not being "underneath" someone and thus not able to stand. This doesn't make it -1 by itself; someone domming could easily at 6 or more, directing their partner's every move.

Also, it should be obvious, but not all subs will be acting below 1. It's quite common for subs to have plenty of freedom in teasing and acting on their dom!

## Domming: going above 6 Consent Depth

(Github Markdown doesn't like starting lists at 7)

7. I have consent to deeply describe, in specific terms, how the other person's body reacts and mind thinks. eg "You're getting so close, you'll need to cum soon", "you can't stop yourself from X"

8. I have consent to control how the other person acts and reacts, as if they were a doll, toy, pet. I can ignore their suggestions occassionally. eg "I'm so close""your body locks up, caught in place, and though you throb you simply can't climax"

9. I have consent to fully control the other person's feelings, actions, reactions, as if they were a drone or mindcontrolled. I can override or invert anything they suggest. eg "I don't want to be X""You're wanting it more by the second, your brain bending into shape as you can't stop thinking about X"

Also, it should be obvious, but not all doms will be acting above 6. It's quite common for doms to give their sub leeway in interpreting orders and reacting in their own way.
