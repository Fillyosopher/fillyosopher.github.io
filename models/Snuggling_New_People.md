# Snuggling New People

## The Model

Start at 1, go up a step every 10 minutes or so. Stop the moment either person feels uncomfortable, go back one level, and spend the rest of the night on that level!  That way only positive stuff happens (even if one side might have wanted a bit more).

1. Spend time together doing something non-sexual to icebreak
2. Hugging!
3. Massages and other formalized contact
4. Snuggles! (Kiss face!)
5. More massages with less layers of clothes
6. More Snuggles, now w/o clothes! (Kiss body!)
7. Teasing (Kiss fun places!)
8. BJ, HJ, or Naked Showers
9. Penetrative sex/light bondage play

Anything passed this, like heavy bondage or BDSM, is not appropriate escalation without prior consent and planning from both parties.
