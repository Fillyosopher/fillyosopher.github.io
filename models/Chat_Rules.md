# Chat Rules to Type of Channel

## Model

Comments must be: [True, Necessary, Kind, Passionate]
X is how many you expect from the list
Y is how many can break before you enforce rules

x=1: Space for kids
x=2: Space for teens
x=3: Space for adults
x=4: Space for rationalists
y=0: Safe Space
y=1: Space for learners and intersections of culture
y=2: Barely moderated for the age group
y=3: Adult Chaos

## Explaination

As you add additional restrictions to commenting, you create a space aimed toward more and more adult people. At some point though, the restrictions flip over the adult average and begun to be restrictive to even adults.

The most common general restrictions are subsets of:
True: Comments should not lie or intentionally mislead
Necessary: Comments are the righteous thing to say, aim for success
Kind: Comments are the kind thing to say, aim for group happiness
Passionate: Comments should not be lazy, bored

(Of course, topic restrictions are also common and not handled by this model)

While all groups use all 4 rules to some extent, most focus on one or two that they strictly enforce while the rest are simply "cultural preference".

The most disliked members of the community will be those who exploit that "not technically against the rules" to introduce unwanted conversation styles into the group.
